# Design Decisions: Sensors
## Objective
We like to select a set of sensors that would be necessary for Woodbot to solve a particular problem. 
Depending on sets of sensors we pick, we can do state estimations which maybe necessary for our applications.

### We like to 

- Narrow down hardware design 
- Visit each option and conduct experiments
- Conduct design engineering decisions with proper supports

This will require you to fill out highlighted parts for full credits.

***
## Options:
* Option 1: pointy tail
* Option 2: circular tail
* Option 3: no tail

## Experiments:
Using las week codes, modify that so we can run the servos to do the followings:

- back and forth for 1s
- turning 
- spining

on different surfaces

## Results
### How well can each option run straight?
> - your comments on how they behave
> - 

### how well can each option turns?


### is there any edge case for each option?
> - i.e. Option 1 flipped when....

### how each options can affect sensor measurements?
1. Lidar
>* Option 1:
>* Option 2:
>* Option 3:

2. IMU

>* Option 1:
>* Option 2:
>* Option 3:

## Uncertainties
### Was there any uncertainty that we observed with hardware, but not observed in Webots or model?
> - 
> 

### Can we observe the uncertainties on-board?
>- 

### Do you think we need more sensors? If so, what kind?
>-


### Requirements
>- Navigation in an arena (2D plane)
>- A map and an initial state are given
>- Using affordable components and a microprocessor
>- Indoor

### Decisions
which options are good based on the results?
Are they good 


#### My Conclusion: I go with Option 


### Still Unknown, Things to be analyzed and decided later

# Lab 3 Woodbot Hardware


## Requriements
You will assemble the Woodbot hardware and test run it to conduct a design decisions. 

- [ ] Asemble Woodbot and solder the Woodbot PCB board 
- [ ] Flash the firmware on the microprocessor and test run using "run_hardware.py'
- [ ] Run the hardware in the arena to generate the output with "run_hardware_with_mocap"" (Automatically saved upon run)
- [ ] Design decisions on hardware support structure

You will submit above requirements by commit and push all your changes to the remote repository. 
Please submit a link to your forked repository on Canvas.


## Tools
We provide the followings:
- A set of Woodbot hardware body parts
- A set of a PCB board, a microprocessor, actuators, sensors and a battery 
- Alternative support structures for Woodbot
- A test arena for Woodbot hardware and Aruco tag
- All necessary codes

## Hardware Assembly
Go to [Woodbot Firmware](https://git.uclalemur.com/capstone/lab/paperbot) for wiring and installing firmware.

>## Double Check battery wiring!! Fire hazard
 
Then run run_hardware.py. Make sure to connect to ESP wifi first.

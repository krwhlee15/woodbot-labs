# Design Decisions: Sensors
## Objective
We like to select a support structure that would be appropriate for Woodbot to solve a particular problem.
Depending on the structure we pick, we can improve hardware robustness with minimal complexity.

### We like to

- Narrow down support structures that meets necessity and sufficiency
- Visit each option for potential benefits and disadvantages
- Consider possible edge cases for each option
- Conduct experiments to verify your above arguments and identify any other necessary considerations
- Conduct design engineering decisions with proper supports

This will require you to fill out missing parts for full credits.

## List of support structures:
* Pointy wood
* Circular wood
* None
* Ball bearing
* Ball caster
* Caster

## Option 1: Pointy Wood

## Design Decisions:
Now we like to narrow down and make decisions on which support structure to use in the design.

### Requirements
>- Navigation in an arena (2D plane)
>- A map and an initial state are given
>- Using affordable components and a microprocessor
>- Indoor

>- You cannot reset the robot during the operation (You cannot rescue the robot if localization fails)

>- The arena floor is epoxied and reasonably flat
>- The arena contains a small bump around a LEMUR sticker 
>- The arena has tiny hols due to bubble

#### My Conclusion: I go with Option ______ for the prototype

### Still Unknown, Things to be analyzed and decided later

>- We don't know whether our hardware decisions affects previous design decisions
>- We haven't verified our previous design decisions
